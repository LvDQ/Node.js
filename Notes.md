	v8 actually written by c++ so it can run by c++ files with #include <include/v8.h>, so node.js also accpet javascript

	client asks for services request Server performs services response to client.

	the benifit of using node.js is use the same language betwwen browser and web servers.

### how to run a js file : 

1.install node.js 

2. open node.js command prompt 

3. node +[file name]

4. help with Visual Studio Code

### MODULE: 
A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code

### Invoke: 
run the function


## D3: Build a Modeule

we can import other .js files to run in specific place by using function `require()` 

`syntax:` requie('./PATH.js');

if we want to use only one function in the Modeule

then in the modeule files: 

	module .exports = [function_variable];

then go to original files run by:

	var [name] = require('[PATH]');
	[name]();


## D4: Object Literals

if we want to build a structure, just use `{}` and link methods or objects by using `,`, for example:

	var person = {
    	firstname: 'John',
    	lastname: 'Doe',
    	greet: function(){
        	console.log('Hello,' + this.firstname +' '+this.lastname);
    	}
	};

we can recall the object or method by `.` ,such as `person.greet();`  - standard way

we can also use bracket `[]` , such as `console.log(person['firstname'])` and `person['greet']();`
